  <description brief="build_tools">

    Contains tools and scripts for building Southwest Research Institutes MARTI
    autonomous vehicle software and its derivatives. This repository should be
    used to store any and call CMake scripts, as well as packaging and build
    scripts that need to be referenced using rospack or run on vehicles. For 
    user scripts that don't need to be accessible to rospack or run on vehicles,
    use the ivs_conf repository.
